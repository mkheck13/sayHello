# Say Hello

**Description**: Create a console project that prompts the user for their name and then returns the following "Hello "name entered".
                I talked with Bronel about how to do the validation for this prodject and we figured out how to make it work. I added the ability to have a play again feature.

**Comments**: The project works as intended; it asks you for your name, and will return an error if the name doesn't solely include letters, asking the user to try again. Otherwise, the program will greet you with the name inputted and then ask you if you'd like to do it again.
